	<h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
	<p>The Bel-Air Neighborhood Association (BANA) is alive and well because of the helping hands of many neighborhood volunteers. Without the help of our neighborhood volunteers, none of our neighborhood projects would be able to function.</p>
	<p>Anyone can volunteer. If you like, just show up to an event and ask what needs to be done. No meetings. Just your pair of helping hands.  We know there are many people who can bring their considerable talents to their neighbors.  Please share yourself with us.</p>
	<p>We are always looking for volunteers to help on <strong>clean up days</strong> â€“ everything from greeting folks, to picking up trash in the park, to helping clean up trash and illegal dumps in our alleys.  This is a perfect time and place to make a big impact on our neighborhood and meet some of your neighbors.</p>
	<p>All neighborhood events are volunteer driven.  We receive many great ideas but need people to make them happen!</p>
	<p>If you are interested or just want more information about volunteer opportunities, please <a href="/page/contact/">CONTACT US</a> and we'll get back to you right away.</p>
	<p>Thanks for your interest. <strong>If everyone does a little bit, good things happen.</strong></p>
