	<h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
	<p>The Bel-Air Neighborhood Association (BANA) is alive and well because of the helping hands of many neighborhood volunteers. Without the help of our neighborhood volunteers, none of our neighborhood projects would be able to function.</p>
	<p>Anyone can volunteer. If you like, just show up to an event and ask what needs to be done.  No meetings. Just your pair of helping hands.</p>
	<p>Currently, the BANA Board is looking for one more Board member and a co-editor of the BANA Newsletter. Board meetings are short and sweet and we do most of our communicating via e-mail. The 4 page newsletter is published 2-3 times a year.</p>
	<p>If you are interested in either of these positions or just want more information abut volunteer opportunities, please <a href="/page/contact/">CONTACT US</a> and we'll get back to you right away.</p>
	<p>Thanks for your interest. <strong>If everyone does a little bit, good things happen.</strong></p>
