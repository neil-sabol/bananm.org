	<p>One of the city's oldest neighborhoods dating back to the 1950's, Bel-Air is the size of a small town, enclosed between Carlisle and San Mateo, Candelaria and Menaul.</p>
	<p>The neighborhood contains frame and stucco homes, others of cinder block construction, and many others are custom built or refurbished original designs.</p>
	<p>Bel-Air is laid out in a grid pattern with back alley-ways which give access to large backyards. It is a highly liveable area.</p>
